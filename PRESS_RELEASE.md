## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.

My Carbon Footprint

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.

Intended for those who are environmentally conscious who want to assess how their lifestyle contributes to climate change and want solutions on how they may be able to decrease their carbon footprint.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.

The planet is warming and according to scientists we have about 6 years left to take decisive action to keep warming under the 1.5°C threshold. While we cannot stop global warming overnight, or even over the next several decades, we can slow the rate and limit the amount of global warming by reducing human carbon emissions. There is great potential for the collective actions of many individuals worldwide to reduce global warming by making changes in their daily and annual activities. Our app was built on the founding mission that there is power in small collective actions. The Carbon Tracker App allows people to calculate their carbon footprint and provides access to resources on how to lessen their footprint. Additionally, users can make accounts to keep track of how their carbon footprint changes over time. Other potential features include having data visualizations which show how a user’s carbon footprint compares to others, and seeing news articles related to climate change. 

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves. Who experiences this problem?

According to scientists, to stabilize global temperatures at a sustainable level, global greenhouse gas emissions need to reach net zero by 2050. This reality must guide how we live our life. Although some may argue that mid-century deep decarbonization is most achievable by accelerating the deployment of existing zero-carbon technologies this way of thinking leads to overlooking the largest group of key players, humans. To what degree is the average person responsible for climate change? Since 2017 we have seen a rise in the average person within the United States contribution to carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions to exceed more than 16 tons of CO2 per year. The world average is less than half the amount of the lowest carbon emissions of anyone in the US, which is 8.5 tons. The carbon footprint of the average American seems to rise every year, likely due to an increase in consumerism, demand for meat, and transportation.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.

Our product provides users the opportunity to see exactly how their lifestyle has contributed to climate change. The app places the responsibility on each user to contribute to decarbonization by making small changes in their daily life. For instance, if a user opts for a vegetarian meal one day a week it could save the carbon equivalent of driving 1,160 miles per year. It is small changes like this that contributes to achieving our climate deadline in 6 years. 


## Key Technical Challenge ##
  > What will likely be the most challenging technical hurdle you must overcome in order to complete this project?

Collecting and saving user data to a database and analyzing how one person’s data compares to a general group. 
Data scraping to provide information and resources on how a user can decrease their carbon footprint.
Building a creative and fun UI for the quiz users take to know their carbon footprint.

## Extension Opportunities ##
  > What are opportunities for you to expand the scope of this project by adding additional features to solve new but related problems?
Sharing: invite friends to support, challenge, and cheer each other on.
Adding awards for hitting goals
Adding a climate clock
Adding climate news articles(using NYTimes API)
Making use of more API’s related to climate change(transportation API:https://connect.myclimate.org/api-overview )
