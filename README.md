# My-carbon-footprint

My Carbon Footprint is an online calulator that quantifies a person's carbon footprint through a year based on the user's diet, transportation and daily habit. Intended for those who are environmentally conscious who want to assess how their lifestyle contributes to climate change and want solutions on how they may be able to decrease their carbon footprint. The goal is to achieve individual carbon neutrality.
