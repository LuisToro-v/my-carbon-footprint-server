# What is carbon footprint and why is it imporant?

Carbon footprint is the amount of carbon dioxide emissions directly or indirectly is generated from a person's activity. According to current data an average person in the United states emits about 16 tons of CO2 per year compared to 4 tons globally making us one of the highest rates in the world.

The Climate Clock shows two numbers. The first, in red, is our deadline, the time we have left to take decisive action to keep warming under the 1.5°C threshold, a count down of how long it will take, at current rates of emissions, to burn through our carbon budget. The second number, in green, is the growing % of the world’s energy currently supplied from renewable sources. Our lifeline. The goal is to get our lifeline to 100% before our deadline reaches 0.

# My-carbon-footprint

This project aims to help us reach our lifeline before the dealine. My Carbon Footprint is an online calulator that quantifies a person's carbon footprint through a year based on the user's diet, transportation and daily habit. Intended for those who are environmentally conscious who want to assess how their lifestyle contributes to climate change and want solutions on how they may be able to decrease their carbon footprint. The goal is to achieve individual carbon neutrality.
